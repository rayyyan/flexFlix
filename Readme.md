# FlixFlex

- FlixFlex is a mobile app designed for listing movies and series, with Firebase authentication integrated for user authentication.

# choices

- React Native: the choice of React Native is based on my familiarity and experience with the framework, ensuring a smoother development process.

- Typescript: TypeScript was selected as the programming language for this project. It offers static typing, which helps catch errors during development and improves code maintainability and scalability.

- State Management: For state management, the Context API was chosen. Since FlixFlex is a small app, using a lighter state management solution like Context can simplify the development process without the need for additional libraries like Redux. Context provides a simple way to share and manage global state across different components.
- Fetch API: The Fetch API was considered as the method for making API calls to retrieve movie and series data. However, the idea of using Rtq Query was dropped since Redux Toolkit was not being used in the project. Instead, a basic Fetch API approach was chosen to fetch data from the server.

- Reusable Components: Some components from a starter kit that were used in previous projects were utilized in this app. By reusing these components, cozz ihad only 2 days to work on it, it saved me time.
- Reanimated: Reanimated is only used for slick Screen animation .
